Curates movies and TV shows from multiple real sources — Xtream-Codes (XC)
IPTV providers, Plex, and Emby/Jellyfin — into one deduplicated pool, then
re-exposes that pool as its own XC-compatible catalog server so one or more
Dispatcharr instances can pull it like any other provider.

Same real content is often available from several sources at once (a movie
on both an XC reseller and your own Plex library, or the same title from two
different resellers). VOD & DVR Manager treats those as multiple *sources* for one
pool entry rather than duplicate entries, and automatically fails over
between them if one goes down or hits its connection limit.

**New here?** See [USERGUIDE.md](USERGUIDE.md) for a full walkthrough with
screenshots — installation, connecting Dispatcharr (single or multiple
instances), security hardening, and every curation tool. This README is a
concise technical reference for people already up and running.

## Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose
- `ffmpeg` (already included in the Docker image — nothing to install
  separately)
- At least one real VOD source: an XC-type IPTV provider, a Plex server, or
  an Emby/Jellyfin server
- One or more Dispatcharr instances to pull the resulting catalog into
- A free [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) API key (v3 auth)
  — used for enrichment (once a movie/series has a known TMDB id, its detail
  refreshes straight from TMDB instead of your provider, easing load on any
  provider that rate-limits aggressively), the year-review/missing-artwork
  disambiguation flows, and category List Sync; not required for basic operation
- Optional: a free [MDBList](https://mdblist.com) API key — a second public
  list source for category List Sync, alongside TMDB Lists
- Optional: an API key from Anthropic, OpenAI, and/or Google (Gemini) for
  the AI-assisted features (any one is enough; more than one lets you
  switch providers without re-entering a key)

## Quick start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This pulls the published `ghcr.io/jstevenscl/vod-manager:latest` image (see
`docker-compose.yml`). Building from source instead — e.g. for local
development against this repo — works too:

```bash
docker build -t vod-manager:local .
```

The app listens on port `8282`. First run asks you to set an admin
username/password (VOD & DVR Manager's own login, separate from Dispatcharr's) —
see [USERGUIDE.md](USERGUIDE.md#4-first-run-setup) for why you should set
one rather than skip it.

From there: add your real providers (Curation & Maintenance → Providers)
and import their catalogs, then connect Dispatcharr (below). Full
walkthrough with screenshots in [USERGUIDE.md](USERGUIDE.md).

## Connecting Dispatcharr instances

VOD & DVR Manager distinguishes two separate relationships with Dispatcharr:

- **Connected Instances** — *who's allowed to pull from VOD & DVR Manager.* Each
  Dispatcharr instance gets its own auto-generated, high-entropy
  username/password pair. Use VOD & DVR Manager's own URL as the `server_url` on
  an XC-type M3U account in that Dispatcharr instance, with the generated
  credentials.
- **Dispatcharr Connections** — *who VOD & DVR Manager itself reaches out to.*
  Used to push each provider's connection limit into Dispatcharr's own
  admission control, and to check real-time live-TV viewer counts for
  shared-connection-limit coordination (see below).

A single Dispatcharr instance is usually both at once (it pulls from VOD
Manager *and* VOD & DVR Manager pushes profile data back to it), but they don't
have to match — you can have Dispatcharr instances that only pull, and
connections VOD & DVR Manager only reaches out to for coordination.

**Adding a new instance** (Configuration → Dispatcharr Connections →
"Connect a new instance"): give it that instance's own admin API token and VOD
Manager's own URL as reachable *from that instance* — this isn't always the
same URL you're viewing VOD & DVR Manager at yourself (a co-located instance
might use a Docker-internal hostname; a remote one needs your real public
URL). VOD & DVR Manager then automatically creates the client credentials and the
Dispatcharr-side M3U account for you (with a 50-concurrent-stream account-
level cap — generous on purpose, since the real per-provider limits are
enforced separately; see below). The only thing left is on Dispatcharr's
own side: enable VOD on the new account and pick which groups/categories to
turn on — normal setup for any source, regardless of how the account got
created.

On Dispatcharr v0.29.0+, every movie's 18+ status also syncs automatically
as part of the normal VOD refresh, so Dispatcharr's own per-profile "Hide
Mature Content" setting works against VOD & DVR Manager's catalog with no
extra setup. Movies only for now — Dispatcharr has no equivalent flag for
series yet.

## Per-instance category access control

Dispatcharr has no per-user/per-profile VOD split of its own — once content
is pulled in through a Connected Instance's M3U account, every Dispatcharr
user on that instance sees the identical catalog. For real per-audience
control (e.g. a kids-only client, or handing a limited catalog directly to
an end-user IPTV app like TiviMate or IPTV Smarters instead of routing it
through Dispatcharr at all), restrict a specific Connected Instance's
credential to a set of categories under Configuration → Connected Instances
→ *Category access*. Left as "— all —" (the default), a client sees the whole
pool, matching every existing credential's behavior today. Restricting it
is enforced everywhere that credential is used — catalog listing, info
lookups, and the actual stream — not just hidden from the browse UI, so a
restricted client can't reach disallowed content even with a direct/copied
stream URL.

## In-app test player

Movies, series episodes, and Needs Review items all have a Play button that
opens a lightweight in-app player — meant for verifying imports (matched the
right title, source actually plays, etc.), not real end-user viewing (real
viewers watch through Dispatcharr with an external player, which never goes
through this player at all). Direct playback works for anything a stock
`<video>` element can decode natively; two fallbacks cover the rest, both
re-encoding the source with ffmpeg on the fly rather than just relaying it:

- **Transcoded** — fast to start, but forward-only (no mid-stream
  scrubbing). "Jump to" buttons restart the stream partway in instead.
- **HLS (seekable)** — real seek support via a proper HLS playlist +
  segments, at the cost of a slower start (ffmpeg has to produce a first
  segment before anything plays) and using somewhat more CPU/disk while
  active. Backward seek works across everything encoded so far; seeking
  past the live edge is naturally blocked until ffmpeg catches up, the same
  limitation any in-progress live/event HLS stream has.

Both fallbacks (and every other player-facing route) are torn down when a
session ends — closing the player, an idle timeout with no further
requests, or a Kill from Activity below all release the encoder process and
any on-disk segments.

## AI-assisted categories, Needs Review, and Missing Artwork

An API key from **any** of Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google Gemini (Configuration
→ API Keys — configure as many as you have access to, then pick which one
is active) unlocks three assists, none of which ever apply anything
automatically — every one is a suggestion you still review and confirm:

- **Suggest a category with AI** (Categories) — describe a category in
  plain English and the AI proposes a structured filter rule using the
  same fields/ops the manual rule builder uses (name, genre, year,
  country/language, director, is_adult). Good for anything expressible as
  field conditions; review the proposed rule before creating it.
- **AI Evaluate** (✨ button on any category) — for criteria the rule
  fields genuinely can't express (mood, plot, audience fit), the AI judges
  actual titles against a plain-English description instead of matching
  fields. Real per-request API cost, so this always runs over a *bounded*
  candidate set (optionally narrowed first by a rule pre-filter) rather
  than the whole pool — the result always reports how many candidates were
  actually considered vs. left out by the cap, never a silent truncation.
- **Ask AI** (Needs Review, Missing Artwork) — when an item has no year, or
  no confident poster match, and multiple TMDB candidates are ambiguous,
  the AI picks the most likely correct match with its reasoning and a
  confidence level, as an extra hint alongside the normal TMDB suggestion
  list. You still click a candidate yourself to actually resolve it.
- **Bulk resolve with AI** (Needs Review, Missing Artwork, Duplicate Finder)
  — the same three judgments as above, run as a background job over a
  batch you select instead of one item at a time. Only ever applies a
  fix when the AI reports *high* confidence — anything medium/low/no-match
  is left untouched with its reasoning shown, never guessed into the pool.
  Duplicate Finder's version only calls the AI when a group has no shared
  TMDB id at all; a group that already agrees on one merges immediately, no
  AI call needed, and a group with a genuine *conflicting* TMDB id is never
  merged regardless of what the AI says.

See [USERGUIDE.md](USERGUIDE.md#11-curation-tools) for the full set of
curation tools (Missing Artwork, Language Filter, Duplicate Finder, Needs
Review, Orphan Checker) with screenshots.

## DVR recordings

DVR isn't a separate provider you add — it's a capability you turn on for a
Dispatcharr connection you already have, so a connection's finished
recordings flow into the same pool as everything else. Beyond ingestion, it
covers EPG-driven Recording Rules (VOD & DVR Manager's own replacement for
Dispatcharr's own Series Rules, which have a channel-matching bug), backfill
(reuse existing pooled content instead of re-recording), per-person disk
quotas/stream limits/retention, a Missing Episodes view, Metrics, and a
separate self-service Portal so end users can schedule and manage their own
recordings without touching the admin UI at all. Each person's Portal
account records into their own explicitly-assigned DVR category — there's
no silent shared default, by design (see
[USERGUIDE.md](USERGUIDE.md#7-dvr-recordings) for why). An opt-in **delete
from Dispatcharr once safely copied** setting keeps Dispatcharr's own
storage from filling up forever with content VOD & DVR Manager has already
absorbed — off by default, and only ever deletes after a byte-verified
independent copy exists. Full setup
(including the local-path-vs-download-mode decision, which is easy to get
wrong) and screenshots in [USERGUIDE.md](USERGUIDE.md#7-dvr-recordings).

## Shared connection-limit coordination

If a real provider also has its own native live-TV account somewhere in
Dispatcharr (common — the same IPTV subscription usually serves both live
channels and VOD), live TV and VOD & DVR Manager's own usage draw from the same
real connection pool without either side knowing about the other by
default. Configure it under Providers → *Shared Limit / Live Accounts*:

- **Shared Limit** — the provider's real total connection cap (from your
  subscription).
- **Live accounts** — link the provider to its native live-TV account on
  each Dispatcharr connection that has one, optionally scoped to one
  specific M3U profile on that account rather than the whole thing. A
  provider can have a different live-TV account on more than one
  Dispatcharr instance; all of them count toward the same real limit.

VOD & DVR Manager checks the current combined usage (its own active streams +
every linked live account's viewer count) before opening a new stream
against that provider, and fails over to the next available source instead
of exceeding the real limit.

**Multiple providers on the same real login** are also automatically pooled
together, the same way Dispatcharr's own connection tracking does it:
credentials are compared (username + password, decrypted for the
comparison) across your active providers, and any that share the exact same
real login count against one shared limit rather than each getting their
own — since they *are* the same underlying subscription regardless of how
many separate provider rows you've set up for it.

## Multi-account providers (sub-accounts)

Some subscriptions aren't one login — they're several separate logins sold
as a bundle (e.g. a "5x1" package: five independent single-connection
accounts). Dispatcharr represents this with M3U *profiles* under one
source; VOD & DVR Manager now has the same concept natively: a provider can
hold multiple **sub-accounts**, each with its own real username, password,
and connection limit.

Configure it under Providers → *Sub-accounts* (expand a provider row):

- Add each real login as a sub-account, with its own `max_streams` (0 =
  unlimited).
- VOD & DVR Manager tries active sub-accounts in order and picks the first
  one with a free slot when opening a stream — matching Dispatcharr's own
  default-then-next-profile failover exactly, not a summed/aggregate limit.
- Sub-accounts can be individually deactivated (e.g. a login temporarily
  suspended) without touching the rest of the provider.
- Providers without any sub-accounts configured behave exactly as before —
  this is purely additive.

**Already split into separate provider rows?** If you previously worked
around this by manually creating one VOD & DVR Manager provider per login
(the only option before sub-accounts existed), use **Merge Providers**
(Providers page → *Merge Providers*) to consolidate them: pick a primary
provider and one or more others to fold in as its sub-accounts. Content is
never deleted — every source re-points to the primary provider, and any
Dispatcharr live-account links move over too. If a merge finds the same
piece of content already present on both providers (a genuine collision,
not just a duplicate), that item is left on the old row and reported back
so you can resolve it by hand; the old row is only removed once it's fully
empty.

## Security and deployment

- **Set an admin login and don't skip it.** Until a login is configured,
  every API route is unauthenticated — a startup log warning and an in-UI
  confirmation are both there specifically to make this hard to overlook.
- **Don't expose this to the public internet without TLS in front of it.**
  The app itself doesn't terminate TLS — put a reverse proxy or VPN/tunnel
  (Cloudflare Tunnel, WireGuard, etc.) in front if it needs to be reachable
  from outside your own network. This matters more than usual here: the XC
  protocol itself has no concept of session auth beyond a username/password
  in the URL, checked on every request — that's a real, if unavoidable,
  weak point once anything is internet-facing.
- **Login passwords are hashed with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** (260,000
  iterations), not a fast general-purpose hash — resistant to offline
  brute-forcing if the config file ever leaked.
- **Provider passwords, Dispatcharr tokens, and XC client secrets are
  encrypted at rest** in the database, not stored in plaintext. The
  encryption key lives in `config.json` so it travels with that file's own
  backup/restore/reset flow; existing plaintext values from before this was
  added upgrade automatically on next startup.
- **Both the admin login and the XC (streaming) login have brute-force
  lockout** — repeated failed attempts from one address get temporarily
  locked out (XC lockout is configurable under Configuration → Security;
  changes apply within ~30s). This slows down automated brute-forcing but
  doesn't replace putting this behind a VPN/tunnel if it's ever going to be
  reachable beyond a trusted network. Lockout state is in-memory and resets
  on every container restart — a restart-and-retry attacker is a much
  smaller threat than an internet-facing app with no lockout at all.
- **Streaming credentials are never written to logs.** The XC protocol
  embeds them in the URL itself (its own convention, not ours) — both the
  app's own logging and the container's access log redact them before
  anything is written to stdout.
- **Every connected instance gets its own credential**, not a shared one —
  Configuration → Connected Instances. Revoke or regenerate one without
  affecting the others if a specific instance's credential is ever
  compromised.
- **Optional per-instance IP allowlist** — if a specific connected
  instance's source IP is known and stable, you can lock its credential to
  that IP as an extra layer. Leave it blank for instances behind
  CGNAT/rotating IPs (locking those would just break them, not add real
  security, since the address isn't a reliable identity signal for them
  anyway).

## Refresh schedule

Configuration → Refresh Schedule controls how often background work runs:

- **Catalog refresh** — how often each provider *type* (XC, Plex, Emby,
  Jellyfin) gets automatically re-imported, each on its own interval.
  Plex/Emby libraries can take much longer to scan than a cheap XC catalog
  pull, so they're not forced onto the same cadence. Defaults to 6 hours for
  every type.
- **Enrichment TTL** — how long detail-level metadata (posters, cast, genre)
  is cached before a movie/series is eligible to be refetched. Defaults to
  24 hours.
- **List Sync** — how often categories with a linked public list source
  (TMDB List or MDBList) auto-resync. Off (manual "Sync now" only) by
  default — enabling it adds new recurring API traffic to whichever
  source(s) each category uses.

## Backup and restore

Configuration → Backup & Restore lets you download, restore, or reset each
piece of VOD & DVR Manager's state independently (config, sessions, the catalog
database) — e.g. reset a corrupted database without touching saved
credentials, or roll back just the config. Database downloads use SQLite's
`VACUUM INTO` for a consistent snapshot even while the app is actively
writing to it.

Configuration → Diagnostics downloads the app's own log history with
credentials, hostnames, and IP addresses scrubbed — safe to share when
reporting a bug or asking for help.

## Curation tools

Curation & Maintenance and the Movies/TV Shows toolbars host a set of
catalog-quality tools — **Missing Artwork** (bulk poster fixing, with a
language-aware filter and sibling-safe bulk archiving), **Language Filter**
(the same language filtering over your whole library, not just
poster-missing items), **Duplicate Finder** (matches on punctuation
variants, adjacent-year mislabeling, and TMDB id, with one-click bulk merges
for both fully-corroborated TMDB-confirmed matches and a second, separate
tier where only one candidate carries a self-consistent TMDB id; an opt-in,
off-by-default checkbox also groups a quality-tagged title like "4K: Movie"
with its plain "Movie" as a candidate, for consolidating with Stream
Priority's quality mode below), **Needs
Review** (resolves year-ambiguous imports), and **Orphan Checker** (finds
dead rows a provider deletion can leave behind — a series whose only source
provider no longer exists, or movies/episodes with zero sources at all).
Every movie/series can also be manually renamed or have its year corrected
from its own detail view, for whatever a provider's own catalog data got
wrong with no other way to fix it — including setting its TMDB id directly
when you already know the correct match, and (for a series) editing an
individual episode's name/number. **Apply TMDB Titles** (Movies/TV Shows
toolbar) does this in bulk for every already-confirmed TMDB match at once,
instead of one item at a time. **Client Title Format** (Curation &
Maintenance) is a separate, ongoing setting to have VOD clients see a
"(Year)" suffix on every title, independent of the pool's own stored data.

**Flag as wrong content** (the flag icon on any movie, series, episode, or
individual source) reports "this isn't actually what its label says" —
Curation & Maintenance's **Flagged Content** queue lists everything flagged
across the whole catalog in one place. Resolving there just clears the
flag; fix the actual mismatch (rename, re-match TMDB, move/remove the wrong
source) from the item itself first.

**Category List Sync** (Manage Categories → the list icon on any category)
auto-populates a category from one or more public lists — a TMDB List
and/or an MDBList list, mixed freely on the same category — matching each
list entry against your pool by TMDB id first, falling back to a forgiving
title+year match. Two sync modes: **Add only** (default) never removes
anything already placed, for a curated category you're still hand-tuning;
**Mirror** also removes anything no longer on any linked list, keeping the
category an exact reflection of its source(s) (e.g. a "Top 100" list that
cycles over time) — skipped for that pass if any linked source's fetch
fails, so a transient error never looks like "everything's gone."

**Auto-create categories** (per provider, Providers → *Auto-create
categories*) creates a Smart Category for every distinct category name a
provider reports on import, matched via that item's own provider-category
tag — so your VOD & DVR Manager categories mirror the provider's own grouping
without hand-building a rule for each one. Two providers that both have a
category literally named "Comedy" share one VOD & DVR Manager "Comedy" category
rather than creating a duplicate. Never overwrites a category you've already
built by hand with the same name — it only ever fills in what's missing.

![Auto-create categories checkbox on a provider](docs/screenshots/provider-auto-create-categories.png)

**Archive new categories** (per provider, next to *Auto-create categories*)
auto-archives any category a provider reports for the first time, catching
it before it lands in your library instead of after — off by default, and
never retroactively archives a category the provider was already reporting
before you turned it on.

**Stream priority** (Curation & Maintenance → *Stream Priority*) controls
which of a pool item's multiple real sources gets used first when more than
one provider has the same content: by provider priority (today's default),
by detected quality (4K/1080p/HD, sniffed from the source's own name/
category), or either one as primary with the other as tiebreaker.
