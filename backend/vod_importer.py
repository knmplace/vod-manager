"""
Imports a real provider's VOD catalog into our own pool.

Two-phase, matching how Dispatcharr itself (and every XC client) actually
handles this: a cheap bulk list import (name/year/category/stream_id — one
call for the whole catalog) now, and expensive per-item detail enrichment
(genre, cast, tmdb_id, poster, description) fetched lazily on demand and
cached (see vod_db.ENRICHMENT_TTL_SECONDS). bulk_enrich_all() below covers
the whole pool at once, still one item at a time under the hood, just with
bounded concurrency instead of a human clicking one movie at a time.

    """Import-time equivalent of the manual Language Filter archive tool --
    deliberately NOT sibling-safe (see USERGUIDE's Language Filter section
    for that tool's "don't archive the only copy" behavior): an explicit
    exclusion rule means "I don't want this content in my library at all",
    not "prefer another language's copy if one exists". Language rules are
    global (config.get_import_language_exclusion); category rules are
    per-provider (providers.import_exclude_categories), since available
    categories genuinely differ provider to provider.

    Formerly _should_auto_archive: an excluded item used to still be fully
    imported and stored, just tagged auto_archive=True (hidden from review
    queues, but otherwise fully present -- see vod_db.bulk_set_review_
    excluded's "still fully browsable/playable/categorizable" archive
    semantics). Per user direction (2026-09-10, referencing Dispatcharr's
    VOD-group "unchecked = not imported" setting): a real exclusion should
    mean the content is never stored at all. Every caller now uses this to
    filter the item out of movie_items/series_items entirely, before it
    ever reaches bulk_import_movies/bulk_import_series, instead of tagging
    it for archive after the fact. Re-including a category (or removing a
    language-exclusion rule) then re-importing is what brings the content
    back -- see vod_db.purge_excluded_archived_content for the matching
    one-time cleanup of rows that were archived under the old behavior.

    provider_category_name/provider_exclude_categories default to no-ops
    for callers that only want language rules -- plex_importer.py/
    emby_vod_importer.py (GH#9) pass their own provider's library/
    collection-folder name in this same field, since a Plex library
    section (or Emby/Jellyfin virtual folder) is exactly what a user means
    by "category" for those provider types, even though it's not an
    XC-style flat category list under the hood.

    exclude_uncategorized (GH issue #7): a real provider was found shipping
    movies with no category attached at all -- the category-name check below
    can never catch that (there's no name to compare), so this is a
    dedicated switch, checked only when the item truly has no category,
    never as a substitute for an actual category-name match.

    raw_name (2026-09-12 fix -- discussed previously but never actually
    landed): the language-prefix check below MUST run against the
    provider's untouched raw name, not `name`. By the time callers compute
    `name`, it has already gone through parse_name_year and
    vod_db.apply_rules_to_value(movie_name_rules) -- and the built-in
    Title & Metadata Rules commonly include a rule stripping exactly this
    kind of leading "CODE - " language prefix for display purposes (e.g.
    "ES - 3 días en Malay (2023)" -> "3 días en Malay (2023)"). Checking
    the prefix code on the already-stripped `name` meant it always fell
    back to the "EN" default and passed the enabled_languages gate no
    matter what language the item actually was -- while vod_db.
    _source_language(raw_name) (run separately, later, when storing the
    row) correctly used the untouched raw_name and tagged the row's true
    language. Result: excluded-language content was tagged correctly in
    the DB yet was never actually excluded at import. Falls back to `name`
    when no raw_name is supplied (existing direct callers/tests)."""

# Adaptive per-provider concurrency cap, layered on top of the binary

# provider's own share of the concurrency budget gradually the moment it
# shows trouble (halves it, floor 1), then creeps back up by 1 after a run of
# clean calls -- an AIMD approach, same shape as TCP congestion control, so a
# genuinely-throttled provider settles near whatever concurrency it can
# actually sustain instead of alternating between "wide open" and "fully
# stopped". A healthy provider is never artificially slowed down -- every
# provider starts at _PROVIDER_MAX_CONCURRENCY (today's unrestricted
# behavior) and only narrows in response to an actual failure signal (the
# same _BACKOFF_STATUS_CODES/_BACKOFF_EXCEPTION_TYPES the binary backoff
# already watches for). In-memory only, same as _PROVIDER_BACKOFF -- resets

    real XC panels' bulk get_series list already carries full series detail,
    see bulk_import_series, but never episodes), so this call is
    load-bearing even for a series whose detail fields are already fresh
    from the last bulk import. series_needs_enrichment gates the overall
    "is it worth touching this series at all" decision on the primary
    provider's own last_modified where available, not a blind TTL -- see
    its docstring -- so this mostly only actually runs for a series that's
    genuinely new or has reported a change.

    True multi-provider failover (vod_manager series/episode failover work,
    2026-09-09): a series can now be recorded against several providers at
    once via series_sources (see bulk_import_series), mirroring how
    movie_sources already lets one movie carry several playable sources.
    This loops over every one of them -- not just the legacy
    import_provider_id "primary" -- calling get_series_info on each and
    writing episode_sources rows per provider per episode via the
    unchanged add_episode_source (its ON CONFLICT upsert already handles
    the same episode being reported by multiple providers correctly, that
    part needed no changes). Each source is skipped once its own
    last_seen_at is fresh (series_source_needs_enrichment's simple
    per-source TTL -- deliberately not a full per-source last_modified
    migration, by explicit scope decision, 2026-09-09, to keep this first
    cut small) unless force is set. A source whose get_series_info call
    fails gets consecutive_failures/last_failed_at bumped instead of being
    retried every single pass forever, but never blocks the other sources
    for this series from being tried.

    Returns {"fetched": bool, "reason": str | None} rather than a bare bool
    -- every False outcome used to look identical (nothing happened, no
    error), which meant a real problem (the provider this series was
    imported from got deleted since) was indistinguishable from "already up
    to date, nothing to do" from the caller's side. A caller like the
    year-review panel's "fetch episodes to preview" button needs to tell
    those apart to show something better than a spinner that just resets.
    fetched=True here means "at least one source was actually attempted",
    not "every source succeeded" -- individual per-source failures are
    tracked on their own series_sources rows, not surfaced through this
    return value, matching how a single provider's transient failure never
    used to abort the whole call either.

    Every vod_db call in here (and in enrich_movie above) is offloaded via
    asyncio.to_thread — these are plain synchronous sqlite3 calls, and
    calling them directly on the event loop thread means any lock
    contention (very real: bulk_enrich_all runs 8 of these concurrently

    without raising (ProviderBackoffError counts as non-raising/ok, same as
    _enrich_one's existing semantics -- a backed-off item isn't a provider
    failure, it's deliberately deferred).

    beads-ds8: movie writes are collected in-memory (movie_batch) across all
    of this provider's concurrently-enriching movies instead of each one
    independently acquiring vod_db._WRITE_LOCK via set_movie_enrichment --
    same class of lock contention beads-3po already fixed for series via
    enrich_series_episodes_batch, just at movie-count scale. Flushed in
    _MOVIE_BATCH_CHUNK_SIZE-item chunks as enrichment completes (so one giant
    provider catalog doesn't hold one single enormous uncommitted
    transaction), with a final flush for whatever's left once every item has
    resolved -- this phase does not return until every movie's write has
    actually been committed, so the caller's end-of-run
    auto_merge_movie_by_tmdb sweep never runs against a tmdb_id that's still
    unwritten.

    provider_count: `sem` is ONE semaphore shared across every provider's
    movie phase running
    concurrently in bulk_enrich_all (created once, passed into all of them).
    worker_count used to be `sem._value` outright -- each provider's phase
    claiming the semaphore's FULL configured capacity as its OWN worker
    count, so with N providers running at once, N*sem._value long-lived
    workers all contended for the same sem._value slots. Each provider's own
    workers loop straight back to re-acquire sem the instant they release
    it, so whichever provider's workers start winning slots tends to keep
    winning them in a tight self-reinforcing burst -- unlike the old
    per-item create_task/gather pattern (see below) where task-creation
    order naturally interleaved slot wins across all providers. Passing the
    actual concurrently-running provider_count down lets this phase divide
    the shared semaphore's capacity fairly (min 1 worker) instead of
    claiming it whole; default of 1 preserves existing single-provider
    direct-call behavior/tests unchanged.

    write_queue (plan-doc follow-up "one global writer", 2026-09-14): when
    given, each chunk is put() on this run-wide queue and awaited via a
    per-chunk asyncio.Event instead of calling
    vod_db.apply_movie_enrichment_batch directly -- so this phase's writes
    are serialized against every OTHER concurrently-running provider phase's
    writes (movie or series) through the one _run_global_writer task
    draining the queue, instead of each phase independently reaching its own
    batch-commit point at the same time. When write_queue is None (no
    bulk_enrich_all run in progress), behavior is unchanged: this phase
    writes its own chunks directly.

    CPU-spike follow-up (2026-09-14, user-supplied analysis): this used to
    asyncio.create_task() one item PER movie id up front (a list
    comprehension over every id in the provider's catalog), even though
    `sem` only ever let `sem._value` of them run at once -- against a full
    catalog that's tens of thousands of live Task objects queued in the
    event loop for no added parallelism. Now a fixed pool of `sem`-sized
    long-lived workers pulls one id at a time off a plain asyncio.Queue,
    so at most `sem`'s original capacity worth of ids are ever "live" as
    real coroutines/Tasks; the rest sit as plain ints in the queue until
    their turn. Throughput/concurrency is unchanged -- only the up-front
