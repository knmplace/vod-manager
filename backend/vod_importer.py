"""
Imports a real provider's VOD catalog into our own pool.

Two-phase, matching how Dispatcharr itself (and every XC client) actually
handles this: a cheap bulk list import (name/year/category/stream_id — one
call for the whole catalog) now, and expensive per-item detail enrichment
(genre, cast, tmdb_id, poster, description) fetched lazily on demand and
cached (see vod_db.ENRICHMENT_TTL_SECONDS). bulk_enrich_all() below covers
the whole pool at once, still one item at a time under the hood, just with
bounded concurrency instead of a human clicking one movie at a time.

    deliberately NOT sibling-safe (see USERGUIDE's Language Filter section
    for that tool's "don't archive the only copy" behavior): an explicit
    exclusion rule means "I don't want this content in my library at all",
    not "prefer another language's copy if one exists". Language rules are
    global (config.get_import_language_exclusion); category rules are
    per-provider (providers.import_exclude_categories), since available
    categories genuinely differ provider to provider.

    Formerly _should_auto_archive: an excluded item used to still be fully
    imported and stored, just tagged auto_archive=True (hidden from review
    queues, but otherwise fully present -- see vod_db.bulk_set_review_
    excluded's "still fully browsable/playable/categorizable" archive
    semantics). Per user direction (2026-09-10, referencing Dispatcharr's
    VOD-group "unchecked = not imported" setting): a real exclusion should
    mean the content is never stored at all. Every caller now uses this to
    filter the item out of movie_items/series_items entirely, before it
    ever reaches bulk_import_movies/bulk_import_series, instead of tagging
    it for archive after the fact. Re-including a category (or removing a
    language-exclusion rule) then re-importing is what brings the content
    back -- see vod_db.purge_excluded_archived_content for the matching
    one-time cleanup of rows that were archived under the old behavior.

    provider_category_name/provider_exclude_categories default to no-ops
    for callers that only want language rules -- plex_importer.py/
    emby_vod_importer.py (GH#9) pass their own provider's library/
    collection-folder name in this same field, since a Plex library
    section (or Emby/Jellyfin virtual folder) is exactly what a user means
    by "category" for those provider types, even though it's not an
    XC-style flat category list under the hood.

    exclude_uncategorized (GH issue #7): a real provider was found shipping
    movies with no category attached at all -- the category-name check below
    can never catch that (there's no name to compare), so this is a
    dedicated switch, checked only when the item truly has no category,

# provider's own share of the concurrency budget gradually the moment it
# shows trouble (halves it, floor 1), then creeps back up by 1 after a run of
# clean calls -- an AIMD approach, same shape as TCP congestion control, so a
# genuinely-throttled provider settles near whatever concurrency it can
# actually sustain instead of alternating between "wide open" and "fully
# stopped". A healthy provider is never artificially slowed down -- every

    """Fetch get_series_info -- this is the only source of episodes (most
    real XC panels' bulk get_series list already carries full series detail,
    see bulk_import_series, but never episodes), so this call is
    load-bearing even for a series whose detail fields are already fresh
    from the last bulk import. series_needs_enrichment gates the overall
    "is it worth touching this series at all" decision on the primary
    provider's own last_modified where available, not a blind TTL -- see
    its docstring -- so this mostly only actually runs for a series that's
    genuinely new or has reported a change.

    True multi-provider failover (vod_manager series/episode failover work,
    2026-09-09): a series can now be recorded against several providers at
    once via series_sources (see bulk_import_series), mirroring how
    movie_sources already lets one movie carry several playable sources.
    This loops over every one of them -- not just the legacy
    import_provider_id "primary" -- calling get_series_info on each and
    writing episode_sources rows per provider per episode via the
    unchanged add_episode_source (its ON CONFLICT upsert already handles
    the same episode being reported by multiple providers correctly, that
    part needed no changes). Each source is skipped once its own
    last_seen_at is fresh (series_source_needs_enrichment's simple
    per-source TTL -- deliberately not a full per-source last_modified
    migration, by explicit scope decision, 2026-09-09, to keep this first
    cut small) unless force is set. A source whose get_series_info call
    fails gets consecutive_failures/last_failed_at bumped instead of being
    retried every single pass forever, but never blocks the other sources
    for this series from being tried.

    Returns {"fetched": bool, "reason": str | None} rather than a bare bool
    -- every False outcome used to look identical (nothing happened, no
    error), which meant a real problem (the provider this series was
    imported from got deleted since) was indistinguishable from "already up
    to date, nothing to do" from the caller's side. A caller like the
    year-review panel's "fetch episodes to preview" button needs to tell
    those apart to show something better than a spinner that just resets.
    fetched=True here means "at least one source was actually attempted",
    not "every source succeeded" -- individual per-source failures are
    tracked on their own series_sources rows, not surfaced through this
    return value, matching how a single provider's transient failure never
    used to abort the whole call either.

    Every vod_db call in here (and in enrich_movie above) is offloaded via
    asyncio.to_thread — these are plain synchronous sqlite3 calls, and
    calling them directly on the event loop thread means any lock
    contention (very real: bulk_enrich_all runs 8 of these concurrently
    against the same db file) freezes the ENTIRE process, including
    unrelated concurrent work like a video stream relay. That's what was

    provider's own due catalog refresh -- "whatever the normal provider list
    update is"), the manual "Import catalog" button (vod_routes.py), the
    independent fixed-interval sweep (main.py._uncategorized_sweep_loop),
    and apply_exclusions_job.py -- calling it from all of them means none of
    those paths has to wait on another one to be reflected.

    Also retroactively purges any already-review_excluded item still sitting
    in a category (vod_db.purge_excluded_from_categories) -- covers an
    install that ran import-time exclusion before that bug was fixed, so
    already-wrongly-placed rows actually get cleaned up here rather than
    needing a separate one-off action."""
