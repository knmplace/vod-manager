# ── Discovering real upstream accounts already configured in Dispatcharr ────
# Real user request 2026-07-31: the admin already told Dispatcharr about
# every real XC login when they set up live TV there -- no reason to make
# them retype the same username/password/base_url into a VOD Manager
# provider row by hand, or keep the two in sync manually if a login's
# password ever changes. Confirmed live 2026-07-31 against a real
# Dispatcharr instance: GET /api/m3u/accounts/ returns full plaintext
# username/password (not write-only), so this reads real credentials
# straight from Dispatcharr's own API using the same connection token
# already used everywhere else in this file.
#
# Real gap found live the same day, testing against real multi-login
# providers: an M3U "account" is not always one real login. Dispatcharr
# lets an admin represent several separate real upstream logins as
# distinct "profiles" under one account object, each with its own
# max_streams -- confirmed live, summing real profiles' max_streams
# reproduced the admin's actual known per-provider connection totals
# exactly. Each profile's search_pattern/replace_pattern is a plain
# "username/password" -> "username/password" regex swap applied to the
# account's own base credentials (confirmed live: a profile's
# replace_pattern tokens never equal the account's own base username/
# password when it's rewriting to a different login) -- except the
# always-present "Default" profile, whose pattern is the literal
# passthrough "^(.*)$" -> "$1" (no rewrite at all), meaning Default uses
# the account's own base credentials unchanged. So discovery has to work
# at the PROFILE level, not the account level: each profile (Default
# included) is its own real, independently-capped login candidate.
