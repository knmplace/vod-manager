"""
AI-assisted category creation, Needs Review disambiguation, and missing-
artwork matching, via whichever AI provider the user has configured
(Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini -- see config.get_ai_provider). Three distinct
capabilities, matched to different cost/reliability profiles:

- Light mode (suggest_category_rule): one AI call translates a plain-
  English description into the existing smart-category rule_json schema
  (see vod_db.py's _rule_matches) -- cheap, and the result is just a
  starting point the user reviews/edits in the normal rule editor before
  saving, same as if they'd written the JSON by hand. Nothing is ever
  auto-saved from this call.
- Heavy mode (evaluate_candidates_for_category): for criteria the rule
  schema's handful of fields genuinely can't express (mood, plot elements,
  audience fit -- there's no "keyword" or "cast" field), the AI judges
  actual titles instead of field rules. Real per-item API cost, so this
  always runs over a *bounded* candidate set built by vod_db.get_ai_candidate_rows
  (an optional rule_json pre-filter, capped at a limit), never the raw
  pool, and batches many titles per call rather than one call each.
- suggest_year_review_match: picks the most likely correct match among TMDB
  search candidates already fetched for one Needs Review or missing-artwork
  item, with reasoning. Always a suggestion the reviewer still has to click
  to accept (see vod_routes.py's /needs-review/.../resolve/ and
  /missing-artwork/.../resolve/) -- nothing here ever resolves a match on
  its own.

Every call goes through _call_ai(), which forces a structured tool/function
call on whichever provider is active so the response is always the declared
JSON schema, never freeform prose to parse.
