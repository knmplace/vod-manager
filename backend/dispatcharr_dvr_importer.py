"""
Imports finished Dispatcharr DVR recordings into the VOD pool -- the DVR
counterpart to plex_importer.py/emby_vod_importer.py.

Two modes, chosen per-provider by whether dvr_local_path is set:

- Phase 1a, same-host: a shared/bind-mounted volume. A recording is
  playable the moment it's imported -- movie_sources/episode_sources.
  local_file_path points straight at the file on disk (no bytes ever
  copied), and xc_server.py serves/transcodes it from there with no
  further Dispatcharr involvement.
- Phase 1b, cross-host (dvr_local_path is None): downloads each
  recording's bytes once into VOD Manager's own storage
  (DATA_DIR/dvr_recordings/{provider_id}/...) via
  dispatcharr_dvr_client.download_recording_file, then serves that local
  copy identically to Phase 1a from then on. Confirmed live (dispatch-test,
  v0.27.2, 2026-07-26) that the file-download endpoint takes the same
  X-API-Key auth as everything else -- the one open question blocking this
  is resolved. A recording already present locally (by path) is never
  re-downloaded; a failed download is retried on the next poll cycle
  rather than failing the whole import pass. Stored under a deterministic
  hashed filename (sha256 of provider_id+recording_id), not the real
  show/episode name Dispatcharr gave it -- this is VOD Manager's own copy
  on disk (unlike Phase 1a's shared-volume reference), and a VPS host's
  automated content scan looks at filenames first. The real title lives
  only in the database.

Unlike XC/Plex/Emby, a DVR recording arrives with almost no metadata --
only whatever Dispatcharr's EPG match captured (title/sub_title/description/
season/episode/poster_url when matched) plus the output file's own path.
season/episode ARE available as structured ints on custom_properties
(confirmed live, dispatch-test v0.27.2, 2026-07-25 -- earlier research said
otherwise) and are always preferred; path-pattern parsing is a fallback for
whenever they're ever missing (an EPG-unmatched recording, or an older
Dispatcharr version). A real (but conservative -- exact-title-only) TMDB
search fills in genre-adjacent detail XC/Plex/Emby get for free, only for
fields Dispatcharr's own EPG match didn't already provide. Anything not
confidently resolved lands in the existing Missing Artwork / Needs Review
queues for a human (or AI-assist) to finish, the same as every other
import path already does -- no new review flow invented here.

Writes go through vod_db's bulk_import_plex_movies/bulk_import_plex_series
unmodified (same functions Plex/Emby already share) -- local_file_path is
DVR-specific and deliberately kept out of those shared functions, applied
in a separate small pass afterward instead (set_movie_source_local_paths/
set_episode_source_local_paths), so nothing about the Plex/Emby import path
has to change to support this.

    Third fallback -- for Dispatcharr's own "TV fallback" path template
