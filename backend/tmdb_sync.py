"""
Syncs TMDB public Lists into VOD categories — e.g. a user's own TMDB
watchlist-style list becomes their own named category, auto-populated by
matching each list entry's TMDB id against our own pool (movies.tmdb_id /
series.tmdb_id, already captured during enrichment from the provider's own
TMDB-quality metadata). Exact-id matching only — no fuzzy name/year guessing,
since both sides agree on the same TMDB id space.

A category's sync_source column holds a string like "tmdb_list:1234567".
Only items already present in our pool (i.e. actually available from a real
provider) can ever get placed — this doesn't pull in new content, it just
organizes what's already there according to an external list.

    'series' (mapped to TMDB's own 'movie'/'tv' search endpoints). query is
    caller-supplied rather than always the pool item's own stored name --
    the same title is sometimes released under a different name in a
    different region (e.g. a film's international title vs. its North
    American one), and TMDB's search only finds what actually matches the
    query string, so a fixed auto-derived query can't be fixed in code —
    letting the reviewer type what they think it's actually called is the

    Includes overview/rating/cast (and, for series, season/episode counts)

    bound how many of those extra calls one lookup makes.

    common word like "Action" returns 150+ results, and most aren't actually
    titled "Action" (e.g. "Action Man", "Justice League Action", "World in
    Action"). Left in TMDB's own popularity-ranked order, those often
    outrank an exact-title match that's just less well-known, pushing it
    past the cap entirely (a real case: an exact "Action" (2024) ranked 6th,
    one past the cutoff). Re-sorted so exact (case-insensitive) title
    matches come first, before applying the cap -- TMDB's relative ordering

# sync_category/sync_all moved to vod_list_sync.py 2026-09-07, generalized
# to support more than one list source per category (TMDB Lists + MDBList,
# any mix) -- see that module for the current fetch/match/place logic.
# normalize_list_items above is this module's contribution to that shared
# loop (mdblist_sync.fetch_list_items returns the same normalized shape).
