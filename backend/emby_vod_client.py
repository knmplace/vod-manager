"""
Thin client over the Emby / Jellyfin API — used by emby_vod_importer.py to
pull a user's own Emby or Jellyfin library into the VOD pool, and by
xc_server.py to build a direct-play stream URL at playback time.

Distinct from the repo's existing emby_client.py, which talks to a *different*
Emby instance for the unrelated Live TV / Gracenote channel-matching feature
(main.py's "Emby Sync" tab) — do not conflate the two. This one is scoped to
rows in the VOD providers table (provider_type='emby'|'jellyfin'), same shape
as plex_client.py: the API key lives in providers.password, providers.
username is unused.

Emby and Jellyfin share the same core API surface (Jellyfin forked from
Emby), including the /emby/* path aliases Jellyfin kept for client
compatibility — so one client covers both; nothing here branches on
provider_type.
